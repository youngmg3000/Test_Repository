Wu Tang Clan coming atcha
Watch your step kid
Watch your step kid
Watch your step kid
I smoke on the mike like smokin' joe frazier
The hell raiser, raising hell with the flava
Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan
Swingin' through your town like your neighborhood Spider Man
So auh, tik tok keep tikkin
While I keep ya sippin from the lycs that I'm kickin
The lone Ranger, code red, DANGER!
Deep in park with the dark of the smart chirads
With two parts to handle, I'm saying gooooodbye
Like Dave and Cambel

------Skippng to Method Man------

Niggas off, because I'm hot like sauce
The smoke from the lyrical blunt make me
***COUGH SOUND***

-----U-God-----

Ooooh, Oh crap my nut get screwed
Oooow, In come my Shaolin Style
Uuuuu, B. A. my B. Y. U.
To my crew with the Suuuuuuuu
